      title: 'Anti-Wrinkle Treatment',
      description: 'Wrinkles are a natural part of the ageing process. With age, our skin gets thinner, drier and we lose elastin. The ability of our skin to protect itself is reduced as we age. Eventually, wrinkles, creases, and lines form on our skin. Continuous muscle contraction is also another major contributor to facial wrinkles. Continuous muscle movement causes dynamic wrinkles which only appear when the muscle is used. Over time, if untreated, these wrinkles can become static wrinkles which means they become permanently etched in our skin.'
